# tuist-swift-cli-template

## Getting Started

To make this template available for scaffolding anywhere, I recommend cloning this to where tuist gets installed in your local user directory.
`~/.tuist/Versions/**/Templates`

Once there, you can verify it's availability by running:
```
tuist scaffold list
```
You should see it listed
```
Name     Description
